Description: This package takes a CSV file with addresses (potentially with other variables),
    the latitude and longitude coordinates through Google Maps API, and appends them to the 
    existing data to produce a new file. The main function also allows the user to identify separate
    components of the address, like province or postal code. Note that this is designed for 
    Canadian addresses only (this may change going forward).
